# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript I created a day planner with an nine-hour work day and the save button saves the user's input into local storage. The application is able to calculate the current date and time by using moment.js to call the system time settings on your device. This application is great for people wanting a simple day planner to help coordinate a busy schedule!
